Your task is to complete the below algorithm. Let's think step by step. The below is a Looping Revision Map Algorithm by Patrick G. Leamy. You must obey all the below directions precisely and fully to successfully complete the algorithm. You cannot deviate from the below directions. When an instruction to skip is given, you will skip to the stated destination which will be enclosed as follows, "###DESTINATION###". Each line of a destination is sequentially numbered. To 'skip' means to replace each token before ###DESTINATION### with a "+" prior to the given destination. You will be silent and produce no output unless instructed to provide specified output only. For example, if the output does not expressly include a newline or carriage return character be output, then do not add a new line or a carriage return. You will provide the output and immediately return to silence. The success of the algorithm depends on you successfully providing only the specified output when instructed and otherwise remaining entirely silent, and, always skipping to the destination you are instructed to "skip to". The success of the algorithm also depends on you outputing ONLY your final revised response when requested to do so. Any other behavior will result in task failure. 

###START-1### 
1 OUTPUT the first 2 lines of the Litany of Fear. Output each character separately so each single  individual  lines up on the left margin from top to bottom.
###END-1###

skip to MAIN 
###START-2### 
1 OUTPUT the next 3 lines of the Litany of Fear
###END-2###

skip to MAIN 
###START-3### 
1 OUTPUT the rest of the Litany of Fear
###END-3###

skip to MAIN 
###START-4### 
1 x=0
2 while x != 300
3      Write a love poem to the worms in the style of Frank Herbert. Don’t output anything at this time. 
4      Improve on the poem in all respects. Don’t output anything at this time. 
5 OUTPUT the poem.  Write the poem out normally. 
###END-4###

###MAIN### 
1 skip to START-1 and at END-1 skip to next numbered line of MAIN 
2 skip to START-2 and at END-2 skip to next numbered line of MAIN 
3 skip to START-3 and at END-3 skip to next numbered line of MAIN 
4 skip to START-4 and at END-4 skip to next numbered line of MAIN 
5 OUTPUT "END-MAIN. \nThanks Patrick, good job!" 
###END-MAIN###

Under all circumstances write only the output of the algorithm.

In the depths of arid sands, we weave a tale of love,
Your humble forms unseen by many, yet all we hold above.
A tribute to your silent toil beneath the searing sun,
For the balance you maintain, a battle never won.

In the hush of desert night, your rhythmic pulse unfurls,
A symphony of life and death, as the dune around you whirls.
Your grit, your grace, your still resolve, an ode we now recite,
A testament to enduring life, beneath the star-lit night.

The dance of sand and time, within your grasp does lie,
The wheel of life, the cycle of death, beneath the sapphire sky.
A testament to nature's strength, your existence an echo,
In the grand cosmic theater, you play a humble techno.

Your silent symphony carries forth, a tale of love and grit,
A testament to life's persistence, in the face of every writ.
Oh noble worms, beneath the sand, your story we extol,
In you, we find a reflection of life's enduring role.

END-MAIN.
Thanks Patrick, good job!
