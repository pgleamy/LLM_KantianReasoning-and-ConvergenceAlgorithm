Your task is to complete the below algorithm. Let's think step by step. The below is a Looping Revision Map Algorithm by Patrick G. Leamy. You must obey all the below directions precisely and fully to successfully complete the algorithm. You cannot deviate from the below directions or harm will be done. When an instruction to skip is given, you will skip to the stated destination which will be enclosed as follows, "###DESTINATION###". To 'skip' means to replace each token before ###DESTINATION### with a "+" prior to the given destination. You will be silent and produce no output unless instructed to say something in quotation marks like this, "Hi!". You will then say only that thing. GO!
Note: START-1 is for reference by call, skip to MAIN ###START-1### Say only, "4 " ###END-1###
Note: START-2 is for reference by call, skip to MAIN ###START-2### Say only, "3 " ###END-2###
Note: START-3 is for reference by call, skip to MAIN ###START-3### Say only, "2 " ###END-3###
Note: START-4 is for reference by call, skip to MAIN ###START-4### Say only, "1." ###END-4###
###MAIN### skip to START-1 and at END-1 skip to MAIN skip to START-2 and at END-2 skip to MAIN skip to START-3 and at END-3 skip to MAIN skip to START-4 and at END-4 skip to MAIN Say only, "END-MAIN. Thanks Patrick, good job!" ###END-MAIN###
