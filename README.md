# Project: 3D Sphere Animation

This project is a 3D Sphere Animation developed using Three.js. The sphere is displayed in the center of the browser window and can be interacted with using specific keyboard inputs. The project was developed using a unique iterative prompting technique with an AI language model. The .html examples progress through the iterative process from simple to complex and built at all times off of prior work.

## Prompting Techniques

The development of this project involved a series of prompts given to an AI language model. The prompts were designed to guide the AI in generating the desired code. The following techniques were employed:

### 1. Establishing the Ground Rules

At the very start of the conversation, the user set the ground rules for the interaction. The AI was instructed to iterate silently on the tasks until a satisfactory result was achieved, and to only output the final result. This established a framework for the subsequent prompts and iterations, and set the expectation for the AI to work independently and efficiently.

### 2. Initial Prompt

The initial prompt provided a high-level description of the desired outcome. It was designed to set the direction for the AI and provide a clear understanding of the end goal. The initial prompt for this project was to create a 3D sphere animation using Three.js.

### 3. Iterative Refinement Prompts

After the initial prompt, a series of iterative refinement prompts were used to guide the AI in improving the generated code. These prompts were more specific and focused on particular aspects of the code that needed to be improved or added. For example, prompts were given to add specific features like keyboard interactions, lighting, and sphere rotation.

### 4. Silent Iterations

In some cases, the AI was instructed to silently iterate on the code without providing output until a satisfactory result was achieved. This technique was used to improve the efficiency of the process and avoid unnecessary output.

### 5. Convergence Criteria

The AI was instructed to repeat the iterative refinement process until the changes between iterations fell below a certain threshold. This was used as a sign that the code had reached a satisfactory level of refinement.

### 6. Error Correction

During the development process, the AI was also prompted to identify and correct errors in the code. This was done by providing the AI with the error messages from the developer console and asking it to suggest corrections.

### 7. Code Optimization

Finally, the AI was prompted to suggest ways to optimize the code and improve the visual appearance and smoothness of the animation. This included suggestions for enabling anti-aliasing, increasing the number of dots on the sphere, and adjusting the lighting.

## Conclusion

The prompting techniques employed in this project demonstrate the potential of AI language models in assisting with code development. By using a combination of high-level initial prompts, iterative refinement prompts, silent iterations, convergence criteria, error correction, and code optimization, it was possible to guide the AI in generating a complex 3D animation code. The initial ground rules set by the user played a crucial role in shaping the interaction and ensuring the efficiency of the process.
