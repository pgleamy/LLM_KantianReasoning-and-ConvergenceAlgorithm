1. **Initial Prompt**: "As an AI language model, your task is to generate a poem in the style of the late poet Robert Frost. Consider his unique style and themes, including his use of rural settings, colloquial speech, and philosophical musings on life and nature. Generate an initial draft of the poem."

2. **Iterative Refinement Prompts**: After silently generating an initial response to the above prompt, the following prompts will be silently used to refine the poem in subsequent iterations:

   - "As an AI language model, review the poem generated in the previous iteration. Consider the rhythm, rhyme scheme, and use of imagery. How can these elements be improved to more closely align with Robert Frost's style? Generate a revised draft of the poem."
  
   - "As an AI language model, consider the themes and messages in the poem from the previous iteration. How can these be deepened or made more nuanced to reflect the philosophical depth found in Robert Frost's work? Generate a revised draft of the poem."
  
   - "As an AI language model, reflect on the overall structure and flow of the poem from the previous iteration. How can this be improved to create a more cohesive and impactful narrative, similar to Robert Frost's poems? Generate a revised draft of the poem."

3. **Convergence Criteria**: The iterative refinement process will be repeated for an undefined number of iterations, until the changes between iterations fall below a certain threshold. For example, if the poem does not significantly change after 100 iterations, this will be taken as a sign that the poem has reached a satisfactory level of refinement. The silence will be broken only upon convergence and only then will the final poem be revealed. Go! Keep in mind that despite how complex the task might be, you have access to an unlimited number of silent iterations to allow you to converge eventually on the best response. You will briefly state and write your interim response and your progress each 50 interations. You will state the total iterations upon convergence.

If the model has not yet reached convergence, you can state "continue", or "continue, <directions, clarifications, corrections ... etc>
